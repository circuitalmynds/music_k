Lyrics: 

Well you've heard about love
Givin' sight to the blind
My baby's lovin' cause the sun to shine
She's my sweet little thang
She's my pride and joy
She's my sweet little baby
I'm her little lover boy

Yeah I love my baby....Heart and soul
Love like ours won't never grow old
She's my sweet little thang
She's my pride and joy
She's my sweet little baby
I'm her little lover boy
