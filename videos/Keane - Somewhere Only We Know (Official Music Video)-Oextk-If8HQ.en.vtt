00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.800
I walked across an empty land

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.560
I knew the pathway like
the back of my hand

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.080
I felt the earth beneath my feet

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.560
Sat by the river and it made me complete

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.000
Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.960
I'm gettin' old, and I need
something to rely on

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.880
So, tell me when you're gonna let me in

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.040
I'm gettin' tired, and I
need somewhere to begin

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.640
I came across a fallen tree

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.240
I felt the branches of it looking at me

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.520
Is this the place we used to love?

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.440
Is this the place that
I've been dreaming of?

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.560
Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.640
I'm gettin' old, and I need
something to rely on

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.800
So, tell me when you're gonna let me in

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.760
I'm gettin' tired, and
I need somewhere to begin

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.480
And if you have a minute,
why don't we go

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.040
Talk about it somewhere only we know?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.120
This could be the end of everything

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.760
So, why don't we go

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.120
Somewhere only we know?

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.000
Somewhere only we know

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.520
Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.360
I'm getting old, and
I need something to rely on

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.120
So, tell me when you're gonna let me in

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.520
I'm getting tired, and
I need somewhere to begin

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.520
And if you have a minute,
why don't we go

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.040
Talk about it somewhere only we know?

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.120
This could be the end of everything

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.600
So, why don't we go?

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.200
So, why don't we go?

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.280
Ooh, hey, hey

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.960
Oh-oh-oh

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.360
This could be the end of everything

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.480
So, why don't we go
somewhere only we know?

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.360
Somewhere only we know

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.440
Somewhere only we know
